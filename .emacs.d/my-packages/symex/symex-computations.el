  "A computation to be performed as part of a traversal.

COMPONENTS - a list of nested computations that will each process the
input independently and produce a result. These results will then be
filtered and finally considered collectively to produce a decision.
PERCEIVE - the function to be applied to the result of each traversal step,
which transforms it to the perceived type.
SELECT - a predicate function that is applied to perceived values in order
to select the subset of perceptions that will be operated on by nested
computations.
FILTER - a predicate function to be applied to results from nested computations
to select those that will factor into the decision.
DECIDE - a binary function to be applied in combining results from nested
computations (each of the 'perceived' type) to yield the provisional result
(also of the perceived type).
EXPRESS - a function to transform data of the perceived type (e.g. the
type produced by the decision) to the application type (the type that can be
used by the application).
ACT - a binary function to be applied in combining results from the overall
computation (each of the 'expressed' type) to yield the final result
(also of the expressed type)."
